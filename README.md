## Problem/Issue our app is going to address
Existing parking system consist of many disadvantages. The systems only provide the Entrance to the parking area and it does not provide the information about parking slot to the customer. The car owner searches the parking slot after entering to the parking area. It will take time to find the slot. The car owner will be having no idea about which parking area are filled and which are not. It is his responsibility to find the parking slot to park his vehicle safely. It is very difficult for the customer to find his vehicle from a large area of parking after complete his work like shopping. Our app will provide the Position where the Car was parked and the image of the location where it has been parked at the time of entering into the parking itself. The application will also calculate the fare at the time of exit depending upon number of hours the car was in parking.
